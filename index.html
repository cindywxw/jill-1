        <p><strong>JILL</strong> is a system for auditory behavioral and neuroscience experiments. It consists of several independent modules that handle stimulus presentation, vocalization detection, and data recording. With <strong>JILL</strong>, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>record acoustic signals from microphones, triggering acquisition when signals reach a certain loudness</li>
<li>record extracellular neural data from single or multiple electrodes</li>
<li>present sets of acoustic stimuli, with control over the order, spacing, and repetition of individual stimuli.</li>
<li>interface with digital I/O systems for monitoring behavior and giving reinforcement</li>
<li>link modules in a low-latency real-time framework for closed-loop experiments</li>
<li>use any existing JACK program, or write your own!</li>
</ul><p><strong>JILL</strong>  uses the JACK audio framework (<a href="http://jackaudio.org">http://jackaudio.org</a>) to route data between modules and to and from data acquisition (DAQ) hardware. JACK runs on Linux, OS X, and Windows, and supports a wide range of sound cards out of the box. </p>

<p><strong>JILL</strong> and JACK do not require any specialized hardware. If you have a sound card in your computer, you can record audio or neural data. However, there is an ongoing effort to develop third-party drivers for general purpose DAQ cards, including the Intan RHD2000 eval board (see <a href="https://github.com/dmeliza/jack_rhd2000">https://github.com/dmeliza/jack_rhd2000</a>). <strong>JILL</strong> modules can interoperate with any existing JACK modules (e.g. for filtering, synthesis, and visualization). JACK is well-tested and has a large user community.</p>
