The JILL project consists of several components.  

** JILL framework **

The JILL framework is located under jill/.  It consists of a number of
classes designed to facilitate writing new real-time audio processing
modules and running them under the JACK server.

The JILL framework depends on JACK and boost, and requires a
reasonably modern C++ compiler.  To install these packages using yum:

# yum install boost-devel jack-audio-connection-kit-devel

JACK may require additional ALSA or coreaudio libraries to be installed
depending on the platform. Other dependencies include libsndfile and 
libsamplerate:

# yum install libsndfile-devel libsamplerate-devel

To compile the library:

$ scons -Q library

** Tutorial/Modules **

The modules/ directory contains a number of useful JILL modules that
can be assembled into various kinds of toolchains.  The code is
extensively commented and serves as a tutorial on programming in the
JILL framework.  Consult the README file in that directory for more
information.

To compile the modules:

$ scons -Q modules
