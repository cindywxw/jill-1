The JILL project consists of several components.  

* JILL framework

The JILL framework is located under jill/.  It consists of a number of
classes designed to facilitate writing new real-time audio processing
modules and running them under the JACK server.

The JILL framework depends on JACK and boost, and requires a
reasonably modern C++ compiler.  To install these packages using yum:

# yum install boost-devel jack-audio-connection-kit-devel

To compile the library:

$ scons -Q library


* Tutorial

The examples/ directory contains a brief tutorial on programming under
the JILL framework.  The tutorial is contained in comments to the code
in the examples.  In order of increasing complexity:

mixer.cc:  an extremely simple client that copies its input to its output
delay.cc:  a client that adds a fixed time delay between input and output
writer.cc: a client that writes data to a sound file

To compile the examples:

$ scons -Q examples


* Capture client

The 'capture' directory is a self-contained JILL project.  Users
interested in writing new modules should use this as a starting point.
The application monitors its input with a window discriminator to
determine when the amplitude exceeds a certain level, at which point
it begins writing data to a file.  The code is extensively commented,
and can be considered the fourth chapter in the tutorial, if read
starting with capture_test.cc


To compile the capture client, run the following command from the
capture directory:

$ scons -Q
