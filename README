#+TITLE:    JILL Real-Time Auditory Neuroscience Framework

*JILL* is a system for auditory behavioral and neuroscience experiments. It
consists of several independent modules that handle stimulus presentation,
vocalization detection, and data recording. Modules can be connected to send and
receive sampled (e.g. audio or neural) data and event time (e.g. action
potentials, stimulus onsets and offsets) data in a low-latency, real-time
framework.  This modular design provides great flexibility in running closed-
and open-loop experiments.

*JILL* modules use the JACK audio framework (http://jackaudio.org) to route data
between modules and to and from data acquisition (DAQ) hardware. JACK runs on
Linux, OS X, and Windows, and supports a wide range of sound cards out of the
box. There is an ongoing effort to develop third-party drivers for general
purpose DAQ cards, including the Intan RHD2000 eval board
(https://github.com/dmeliza/jack_rhd2000). *JILL* modules can interoperate with
any existing JACK modules (e.g. for filtering, synthesis, and visualization).
JACK is well-tested and has a large user community.

** Requirements

*JILL* andJACK do not require any specialized hardware. If you have a sound card
in your computer, you can record audio or neural data. You do need some
software to build *JILL*:

+ a modern C++ compiler (e.g. g++ 4.4 or later)
+ scons (https://www.scons.org)
+ JACK (http://jackaudio.org; version 1: >= 0.121; or version 2: >= 1.9)
+ boost (http://http://www.boost.org; >= 1.42)
+ libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile; >= 1.0.20)
+ libsamplerate (http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/; > 0.1.7)
+ ARF (https://github.com/dmeliza/arf; >= 2.0)

** Building and Installation

To build the *JILL* modules, run the following command:

: scons -Q modules

You can run the modules from their build directory (e.g. =modules/jstim=). To
install modules in a system location, use the following command:

: scons -Q install --prefix <prefix>

The default prefix is /usr/local, but this can be changed with the
prefix argument.
