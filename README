The JILL project consists of several components.  

First, there is the framework itself, located under jill/.  The
framework consists of a number of classes designed to facilitate
writing new real-time audio processing modules and running them under
the JACK server.

To compile the library:

$ scons -Q library

Second, the examples/ directory contains a brief tutorial on
programming under the JILL framework.  The tutorial is contained in
comments to the code in the examples.  In order of increasing complexity:

mixer:  an extremely simple client that copies its input to its output
delay:  a client that adds a fixed time delay between input and output
writer: a client that writes data to a sound file

To compile the examples:

$ scons -Q examples

Third, the twriter/ directory is a self-contained JILL project.  User
interested in writing their own modules should use this as a starting
point.  The application monitors its input with a window discriminator
to determine when the amplitude exceeds a certain level, at which
point it begins writing data to a file.  The processing logic is
factored out into trigger_writer.hh and trigger_writer.cc.  There
is a test program, twriter_test, and a fully functional JACK program,
twriter, both of which make use of these classes.
