This directory contains several modules that use the JILL framework.
They are intended for general use, and to serve as an introduction to
programming in the JILL framework.  A tutorial can be assembled as follows:

 1. Basic framework:  mixer.cc
 2. Customizing the process loop: delay.cc
 3. Adding main thread processing: writer.cc
 4. Designing a custom processing class: triggered_writer.cc
