{"name":"Jill","tagline":"realtime electrophysiology, behavioral, and acoustic recording system","body":"**mspikes** is a general-purpose tool for processing time-varying data. It can\r\nread and write various formats and perform a range of filtering and detection\r\noperations. You can:\r\n\r\n* filter acoustic recordings\r\n* extract field potentials and spike waveforms from extracellular neural recordings\r\n* export spike times and waveforms for spike sorting (using third-party programs) and import the results\r\n* export spike times to generic formats\r\n* add processing modules as plugins\r\n* design your own mulithreaded processing pipelines using existing or plugin modules\r\n\r\nWant to learn more?
