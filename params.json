{"name":"Jill","tagline":"realtime electrophysiology, behavioral, and acoustic recording system","body":"**JILL** is a system for auditory behavioral and neuroscience experiments. It consists of several independent modules that handle stimulus presentation, vocalization detection, and data recording. With **JILL**, you can:\r\n\r\n* record acoustic signals from microphones, triggering acquisition when signals reach a certain loudness\r\n* record extracellular neural data from single or multiple electrodes\r\n* present sets of acoustic stimuli, with control over the order, spacing, and repetition of individual stimuli.\r\n* interface with digital I/O systems for monitoring behavior and giving reinforcement\r\n* link modules in a low-latency real-time framework for closed-loop experiments\r\n* use any existing JACK program, or write your own!\r\n\r\n**JILL**  uses the JACK audio framework (<http://jackaudio.org>) to route data between modules and to and from data acquisition (DAQ) hardware. JACK runs on Linux, OS X, and Windows, and supports a wide range of sound cards out of the box. \r\n\r\n**JILL** and JACK do not require any specialized hardware. If you have a sound card in your computer, you can record audio or neural data. However, there is an ongoing effort to develop third-party drivers for general purpose DAQ cards, including the Intan RHD2000 eval board (see <https://github.com/dmeliza/jack_rhd2000>). **JILL** modules can interoperate with any existing JACK modules (e.g. for filtering, synthesis, and visualization). JACK is well-tested and has a large user community.\r\n\r\nWant to learn more? Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/dmeliza/mspikes/wiki)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
